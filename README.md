# 3D-Terminal-Background

#### By Andrew Cho

## Description

_Simple website showing the power of Three.js by having hundreds of terminal pngs randomly generated floating changing colors constantly._


## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open index.html to view in browser.

## Known Bugs
_If using Google Chrome as your designated browser, you may get an error in the console about "Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource." which will deny access to the png image. To counteract this please use Python to make a simple server, or just add https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en to your list of extensions._
